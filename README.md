# WebSocket API Examples #

This set of example programs demonstrates how to connect to TREP using the Websocket API, this is part of the Elektron SDK but offered here in a separate repository because it supports a wider array of languages and technologies and can be used in other contexts. This is governed by the same Apache 2 open source license as defined in the LICENSE.md file.

The examples demonstrate the following usage:

* Connecting, logging in, and requesting a single item
* Requesting multiple items with a view in one message via a Batch Request
